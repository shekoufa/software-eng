** This application has a feature to notify the prospective mentors if their application has been accepted or rejected via SMS. The service being used in the application is called twilio.
It is free, but the free version has a limitation to verify all the numbers that can work with this service. Therefor if you want to register as a mentor in our application and want to see
the SMS notification service, before registration, please kindly send us your cellphone number to this address: ns2651@mun.ca
We will send a request to register your cellphone number. After that you will shortly receive a message with an activation code. If you send it back to the same email address, we will finalize
activation of your cellphone number. Having done that, we will send a confirmation email to you, so after that you can receive SMS notifications using the registered cellphone number.
