This is the third project in the â€œBuild your first Node.js website Node.js" 
article.  http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-simplenode3-app/index.html

This project is designed to add Redis database persistence to your application. 
This is a node.js with express server, extended with a user count variable stored in Redis.  
The Redis code is written to account for the asynchronous calls.

Two CoderDojo style step by step worksheets to first deploy the application and then edit it are in the worksheets directory. 
The step by step directions include edits to the text and adding a new variable.  

The solutions directory contains the code after the article or worksheets  is followed.  

The other two projects in the series are:
	NodeJS_Simple_1 - NodeJS server with counter
	NodeJS_Simple_2 - NodeJS server with express, HTML and variable passing.

The project is designed for direct deployment to Bluemix.
